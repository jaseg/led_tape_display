Pink led strip details:
at Vcc = 11.88V, the voltage across the 68R dropper resistor is 2.06V.
Thus, I is 30mA, the forward voltage of the LEDs is 9.82V/3 = 3.27V.
A single group of 3 LEDs dissipates 0.36W. At 60LEDs/m that's 7.2W/m.

We loose 50% brightness due to the 2:1 AC multiplexing and another ~15% due to the generous blanking periods. To make up
for that we need to scale the current by a factor of 2.35. This can be done by increasing VCC from 12.0V to about 14.5V.
Assuming the multiplexing doesn't stop that's not a problem as the power dissipation of the LEDs and dropper resistors
will remain the same as before. We need a safety cutoff in the circle firmware for that though so the LED tape doesn't
burn up if something crashes (FIXME).
